# Simple Anti-Exploit System

A server-side anti-exploit system designed to detect abnormal player behavior.

## Why I Built This
I wanted to learn how game security systems work and how to detect
unfair behavior using logic instead of client trust.

## What I Learned
- Server vs client security in Roblox
- Tracking player movement
- Writing detection logic
